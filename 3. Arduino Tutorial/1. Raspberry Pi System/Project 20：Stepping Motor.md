## Project 20：Stepping Motor 

1.  **Introduction**

Stepper motor is the most important part of industrial robot 3D printer
lathes and other mechanical equipment with accurate positioning. In this
project, we will use a ESP32 to control ULN2003 stepper motor driver
board to drive the stepper motor to rotate.

3.  **Component Knowledge**

**Stepper motor:** It is a motor controlled by a series of
electromagnetic coils. It can rotate by the exact number of degrees (or
steps) needed, allowing you to move it to a precise position and keep it
there. It does this by supplying power to the coil inside the motor in a
very short time, but you must always supply power to the motor to keep
it in the position you want.

There are two basic types of stepping motors, namely unipolar stepping
motor and bipolar stepping motor. In this project, we use a 28-BYJ48
unipolar stepper motor.

**Working Principle:**

The stepper motor is mainly composed of a stator and a rotor. The stator
is fixed. As shown in the figure below, the part of the coil group A, B,
C, and D will generate a magnetic field when the coil group is
energized. The rotor is the rotating part. As follows, the middle part
of the stator, two poles are permanent magnets.

Single -phase four beat: At the beginning, the coils of group A are
turned on, and the poles of the rotor point at A coil. Next, the group A
coil are disconnected, and the group B coils are turned on. The rotor
will turn clockwise to the group B. Then, group B is disconnected, group
C is turned on, and the rotor is turned to group C.

After that, group C is disconnected, and group D is turned on, and the
rotor is turned to group D. Finally, group D is disconnected, group A is
turned on, and the rotor is turned to group A coils. Therefore, rotor
turns 180° and continuously rotates B-C-D-A, which means it runs a
circle (eight phase). As shown below, the rotation principle of stepper
motor is A - B - C - D - A.

Make order inverse(D - C - B - A - D .....) if you want to make stepper
motor rotate anticlockwise.

Half-phase and eight beat: 8 beat adopts single and dual beat way，A - AB
- B - BC - C - CD - D - DA - A ...... ，rotor will rotate half phase in
this order. For example, when A coil is electrified，rotor faces to A
coil , then A and B coil are connected, on this condition, the strongest
magnetic field produced lies in the central part of AB coil, which means
rotating half-phase clockwise.

**Stepper Motor Parameters:**

The rotor rotates one circle when the stepper motor we provide rotates
32 phases and with the output shaft driven by 1:64 reduction geared set.
Therefore the rotation (a circle) of output shaft requires 32 \* 64 =
2048 phases.

The step angle of 4-beat mode of 5V and 4-phase stepper motor is 11.25.
And the step angle of 8-beat mode is 5.625, the reduction ratio is 1:64.

**ULN2003 Stepper Motor Drive Board:** It is a stepper motor driver,
which converts the weak signal into a stronger control signal to drive
the stepper motor. 

The following schematic diagram shows how to use the ULN2003 stepper
motor driver board interface to connect a unipolar stepper motor to the
pins of the ESP32, and shows how to use four TIP120 interfaces.

6.  **Test Result**

Compile and upload the code to ESP32, after the code is uploaded
successfully, power up with a USB cable and you will see that the four
LEDs ( D1,D2,D3 ,D4) on the ULN2003 driver module will light up. The
stepper motor rotates clockwise first, then counterclockwise, and repeat
these actions in an endless loop.
